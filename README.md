A basic Discord Font repository for users/themers who wants to use custom fonts by itself or in their themes.

All Fonts can be found at
https://rairof.github.io/Theme-Fonts/ along with a Gallery section that will showcase each fonts in an organised manner.

Implementation of said fonts are described in [here](https://github.com/Rairof/Theme-Fonts/blob/main/assets/Implementation.md) (OUTDATED NOW!)
